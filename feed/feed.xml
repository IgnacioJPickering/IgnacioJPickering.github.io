    <title>Entropy and the size of stuff</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll start with some ramblings on entropy, which is always an interesting topic for me
to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entropy, to me, is a strange beast. When people describe it they use words that are
closer to the realm of pseudoscience than what they use for many other physical
quantities: &amp;quot;disorder&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;chaos&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;information&amp;quot;, etc. Even when trying to make statements
as precise as possible, these words creep into definitions. I can&#39;t shake the feeling
that there is something fishy about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it is undeniably super useful in the physical sciences, and it has been super
effective in statistics and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different quantities that people associate with the name &amp;quot;entropy&amp;quot;. Most of
them are related enough that they can be lumped together into two main expressions:
the &amp;quot;Boltzmann&amp;quot; entropy and the &amp;quot;Gibbs / Shannon&amp;quot; entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boltzmann entropy is clearly the easiest to understand and reason about. It is the
logarithm of the number of possible states in a system. Suppose you can break a system
$V$ apart into indivisible subsystems, $v$. In this case the Boltzmann entropy is &amp;quot;just&amp;quot;
the size of the system (in terms of these subsystems). This is easy to see, since $W =
v^N$ where $N$ is the size of the system, and since $S_{B} = N &#92;ln v$, the Boltzmann
entropy is, up to a constant, equal to $N$, so it just measures how large the system is.
The easiest example of this is when the system is a number with a given length, the
entropy is then &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; the number of digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this definition and interpretation is pretty reasonable, its not satisfactory
to me. Logarithms are kind of weird, and I don&#39;t think I can make total sense of them
intuitively. If anything, entropy is one of the ways in which logarithms can be made to
make the most sense, or have the most &amp;quot;contact&amp;quot; with something physical (measuring size)
to the point where I wonder if the flow of understanding should be the other way around,
from entropy to logarithms.&lt;/p&gt;
